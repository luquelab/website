# Description
The goal of this repository is to store the content and records of the website(s) associated with the Luque lab and hosted elsewhere. The content is preferentiably stored in text file formats and other reusable formats. This sets best practices in data management for the lab's content and would facilitate migrating website content to other servers or services when needed. This respoitory is the primary source of information for any related website for the lab, so it needs to be updated first before updates are reflected on the websited hosted in other servers. Here is the current list of maintained websites:
+ Temporary website: <https://luquelab.github.io/test_webpage/>

# Content

+ `README.md`: This file includes instructions (see below) on how to maintain and update the repository and reflect changes in associated websites.
+ `/docs`: This folder contains the markdown files with the content for the webistes organized by pages and including page dependencies and instructions for updateing and formatting each page.
+ `/resumes`: This folder contains the Academic CV and functional resume files for current and prior lab members.
