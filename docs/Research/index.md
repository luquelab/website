# Research 

The research in the Luque Lab includes theoretical and computational biophysics as well as mathematical modeling. The aspiration of the lab is to understand the impact of the molecular and physicochemical properties of viruses in viral ecology, ultimately guiding the development of biomedical applications. Our goal aligns with the research of our collaborators in the [Viral Information Institute](http://viralization.org/) at [San Diego State University](http://www.sdsu.edu/).
