| The Luque lab has migrated its website from Weebly to GitHub to power the new lab website: <https://luquelab.github.io/website>. The website's content is available as a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/luquelab/website) under the [luquelab GitHub organization](https://github.com/luquelab). The new HTML website is a GitHub-page site that uses the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) documentation theme for Jekyll. Housing the website in GitHub facilitates version control, integration with other lab repositories and documentation, and a great environment to train new lab members to use GitHub right after joining the team. | ![picture](images/2023-12-28_github-mark.svg) |

| [**Publication of pyCapsid in Bioinformatics**](#publication-of-pycapsid-in-bioinformatics-2023-12-19) | December 19, 2023 |

| **[CSRC colloquium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ayjAqvY3w&ab_channel=SDSUComputationalScienceResearchCenter)** | Feb 11, 2022 |
| The principal investigator Dr. Antoni Luque presented the latest research on "Bridging the Biophysics and Evolution of Viruses" at the [CSRC](https://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/) Colloquium. Dr. Luque introduced the generalized quasi-equivalence theory of icosahedral architectures as a framework to investigate systematically viral architectures and their protein components, showed how the physical relationship between the protein shell and genome of viruses has opened the door to characterize uncultured viruses, predict the existence of unknown viruses, and engineer new viruses from the environment and discussed a novel physical mechanism that may hold the key to how viruses explore different viral architectures. The talk can be viewed on the [CSRC YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1ayjAqvY3w&ab_channel=SDSUComputationalScienceResearchCenter). | ![picture](images/13_csrccolloquium.PNG) |
