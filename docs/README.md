### Home

Here are the guidelines to faciliate that lab news are communicated effectively:
+ Add entry to /docs/news.md
+ Heading: Display short title in bold and include link if appropriate.
+ Heading: Include the date of the news update in the heading line (separate by |. Don't use bold text).
+ Use picture, preferably logo or QR code, that is relevant to the news. Embed the same link used in the heading.
+ Include summary. The ideal content is
  + one sentence describing the main idea of the news,
  + one sentence about contributions or achievements related to the news,
  + one sentence summarizing the significant of impact of the news.
+ Include website or package links for further information, if applicable.
+ It is recommended to copy and edit a prior entry from news.md to facilitate adding the new content.
+ Copy the top three news to index.md so they're displayed directly in the Home page.
