## Alumni 

| [**Diana Lee**](#diana-lee) | PHD Student 2016-2024 <br>**TBD**|
| <img src="images/profile_diana_lee_20XX.jpg" width="200"> <br> <sub> Picture from .... </sub> <br> [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diana-lee-98198a35/) |Diana joined the lab in the summer of 2015. As a returning student, she had just come back to SDSU to complete her BS in Applied Math with an emphasis in Biology. She responded to Dr. Luque’s request for a biomathematics researcher for the summer and quit her full-time job in a leap of faith. Diana graduated in Spring 2016 and then stayed on with Toni as part of the CSRC to pursue a doctorate in Computational Science in the JDP with Claremont Graduate University. Along the way, she was both an LSAMP and IMSD scholar, and was selected as a Viral Information Institute (VII) and CSRC GSTEM Fellow for her first two years of grad school. Diana helped restart the SDSU SIAM chapter, serving as President for the first year back, and was actively involved in SACNAS. She presented her work at SIAM CSE, the Grace Hopper Celebration, and ACSESS conferences, winning awards and gaining valuable contacts in the process. Throughout her studies, Diana faced setbacks with mental health, physical health, and family drama, which ultimately transformed her into an advocate for stronger support for returning graduate students, beyond the usual suggestion of ‘self-care’. She successfully defended her dissertation on June 21, 2024, and now she is returning to work in industry, hoping to continue doing work that can ultimately serve the greater good. As a queer Chicana and a product of the public school system, Diana feels a responsibility to give back to the family and community that supported her. When she’s not staring at her computer working, Diana spends time with one or both of her kids (24 & 11), her dog, three cats, and various plants, or plays TTRPGs with her spouse, reads, writes, and/or makes ridiculous things.|
