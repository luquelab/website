## Alumni 

| [**Colin Brown**](#colin-brown) | Luque Lab Research Assistant / Scientist 2020–2023  <br> **Junior Software Test Engineer at Holland AI LLC** since 2023 |
| <img src="images/colin_brown.jpg" width="200"> <br> <sub> Picture from 2023 </sub> <br> [LinkedIn]([?](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-travis-brown/)) | Colin was a research assistant and research scientist at the Luque lab from April 2020 to August 2023. Colin joined the lab to do research as part of his Master's thesis in physics, and he expanded his scope by developing geometrical and physical models to investigate the protein shell protecting the genome of viruses. He led the release and publication of pyCapsid and contributed to two additional research projects on viral capsids, yielding two co-author publications. He received his Master in Physics from San Diego State University in 2023. |

| [**Anuradha Agarwal**](#anuradha-agarwal) | Luque Lab Technician 2022–2023  <br> **Data Management Specialist at J.P. Morgan** since 2023 |

**Currently a Research Scientist at the [Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC)](https://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/careers/)**
[Google Scholar]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ytvnI68AAAAJ&hl=en](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=uHiSo1UAAAAJ)) \
Ph.D. in Computational Sciences 2019 \
Kevin Joiner developed his Ph.D. research thesis in the lab. Kevin developed new computational and mathematical approaches to investigate the interaction of viruses of bacteria interacting with their bacterial in mucus. He published part of his research in [Scientific Reports](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52794-2). While in the lab, his research was funded by the [DoD SMART Scholarship](https://www.smartscholarship.org/smart), the [NSF S-STEM](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/nsf-scholarships-science-technology-engineering), and the [CSUPERB program](https://www.calstate.edu/impact-of-the-csu/research/csuperb).
