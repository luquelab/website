The principal investigator Dr. Antoni Luque presented the latest research on "Bridging the Biophysics and Evolution of Viruses" at the [CSRC](https://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/) Colloquium. Dr. Luque introduced the generalized quasi-equivalence theory of icosahedral architectures as a framework to investigate systematically viral architectures and their protein components, showed how the physical relationship between the protein shell and genome of viruses has opened the door to characterize uncultured viruses, predict the existence of unknown viruses, and engineer new viruses from the environment and discussed a novel physical mechanism that may hold the key to how viruses explore different viral architectures.

[Diana Lee's](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diana-Lee-4) work associated with the [Luque Lab](https://www.luquelab.com/) and her journey to her [first author paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037021005419?via%3Dihub) identifying links between the shape and genes of virus has been highlighted by SDSU in the [College of Sciences website](https://sciences.sdsu.edu/). With data on hundreds of tail phages, the largest subgroup of bacteriophages, Diana refined a machine learning algorithm called a "random forest" which can predict which features of a virus's genome determine the shape of its shell.
