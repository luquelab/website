Masters student Aurora Vogel submitted an application for the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org) (GRFP). GRFP recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students who have demonstrated the potential to be high achieving scientists and engineers, early in their careers.  Vogel is investigating the geometry of conical capsids (like HIV) in the Luque lab and is a prospective Ph.D. student in Mathematics.
