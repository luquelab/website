### Description

The Luque Lab investigates the physical structure, ecology, and evolution of viruses, combining theoretical biophysics, bioinformatics, and predictive modeling in close collaboration with experimentalists. The lab moved to the [Department of Biology](https://biology.as.miami.edu/) at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu/) in Fall 2023 after nearly eight years forming part of the [Viral Information Institute (VII)](https://viralization.org/) at [San Diego State University](http://www.sdsu.edu/).
